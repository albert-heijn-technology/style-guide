# AH Technology style guide

A comprehensive writing style guide for Albert Heijn Technology that provides automated style checking using [Vale](https://vale.sh).

## What this project offers

This project provides a uniform writing style guide designed to create consistency across all AH Technology documentation and communications.
The style guide includes:

- Automated style checking rules for headings, sentence structure, word choice, and formatting
- Vale configuration files for easy integration into your workflow
- Vocabulary management for technical terms and brand-specific language
- Clear guidelines for inclusive and accessible writing

## Value of a writing style guide

Using a uniform writing style offers several key benefits, supported by extensive research in communication effectiveness and user experience:

- **Enhances clarity and readability** - A consistent style makes documents easier to understand and follow, reducing ambiguity and the chance of misinterpretation. Research from the Nielsen Norman Group demonstrates that improved writing style can increase usability by up to 124% when combining concise, scannable, and objective language[^1].
- **Improves professionalism and brand identity** - Uniformity projects a professional image and reinforces brand consistency across all company communications. Studies show that consistent communication builds credibility and trust, which are crucial factors for web users when evaluating information sources[^2].
- **Increases efficiency** - Writers can create content more quickly by following established guidelines, and readers can find information faster due to predictable structure and language.
- **Simplifies collaboration and maintenance** - When multiple authors contribute, a common style ensures coherence and makes documents easier to update and maintain over time. Clear writing guidelines reduce the cognitive burden on both writers and readers[^3].
- **Facilitates translation and localization** - Consistent terminology and sentence structure simplify the process of translating documents for global audiences. Plain language principles reduce complexity and ambiguity that can complicate translation work.
- **Reduces learning curve** - New employees can more easily understand and absorb information when it's presented in a familiar and consistent format. Research shows that users read only 28% of words on web pages, making clarity and consistency essential for effective communication[^4].
- **Enables enterprise scalability** - Style guides allow organizations to maintain consistency across large, distributed teams and global operations. Both Google and Microsoft demonstrate how comprehensive style guides support thousands of contributors while maintaining quality and coherence[^5][^6].
- **Aligns with industry standards** - Following established patterns used by leading technology companies ensures compatibility with widely adopted practices[^5][^6].
